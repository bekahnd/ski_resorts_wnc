Created by Bekah Downer in 2023.

Description:
This is a website to give you information on the 5 ski resorts in Western North Carolina. I compares the different resorts on things like price and trails and lets members read reviews taken from Google Reviews. It also allows users to post pictures they have taken at any of the resorts or at other resorts. There are public users of the site who get to see only the home page. There are general members of the site, those who have created an account, who can browse the trails, prices, reviews, and gallery on the website. Then there are admin users who can edit information on the database through the website such as prices, trail openings/closures, and making members admin or non admin.

If you would like to see this website please visit https://skiresortswnc.com/public/index.php from there you can create an account and browse the entire website.
